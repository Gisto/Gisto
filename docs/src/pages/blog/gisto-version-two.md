In the past few months we've been working hard on the next major Gisto iteration, a complete re-write of Gisto to version 2 with fresh look and functionality.

<!--more-->

## What is the status?

The current status probably should be called beta.

## What's changed?

Everything except the API end point we talking too :)

- UI completely rewritten with new layout
- Every part of the app rewritten or being rewritten with newer technologies
- Better user experience
- More search and filtering options
- Probably more

Development is currently happening in <a href="https://github.com/Gisto/Gisto/tree/next">next</a> git branch and will be moved to master later on.
