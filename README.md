> Tracked Via issue: [#387](https://github.com/Gisto/Gisto/issues/387)

> [changelog](https://github.com/Gisto/Gisto/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

New version uses [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) instead of electron - what significantly reduces the file size

Previous version can be tracked via the ["master"](https://github.com/Gisto/Gisto/tree/master) branch.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice About Installation

### This App is Not Code-Signed

Since this is an open-source project and we currently do not have the resources to purchase code-signing certificates, the application **is not signed**. As a result:

- **On Windows**: You may see a warning like _"Windows protected your PC"_ or _"Unrecognized app."_
- **On macOS**: You may see a message saying _"This app is from an unidentified developer."_

These warnings are normal for unsigned applications and do not mean the app is harmful. However, always ensure you download the app from the **official release page of this repository** to avoid tampered files.

## How to Install the Unsigned App

### **Windows**:

1. When the warning appears, click **More info**.
2. Select **Run anyway** to proceed with the installation.

### **macOS**:

1. After downloading, if you see the warning, go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General**.
2. Click **Open Anyway** next to the blocked app message.
3. Confirm by clicking **Open** when prompted.

# üîç Privacy/authentication

Gisto authenticates to GitHub by using GitHub Access token

You may manually create an access token from the account settings at GitHub and login using the generated token.

Gisto only saves the Access token in your local storage and nothing else.

This token will be saved permanently until you log out, or it will expire.
